# 2.1.0
*2017-04-29*

**Please note that the minimal version for this theme is now `>=1.13.0` due to the Atom theme API change!**

## Improvements
❯ Migrated to the new Atom theme API.  
Starting from Atom version 1.13, the contents of `atom-text-editor` [elements are no longer encapsulated within a shadow DOM boundary](http://blog.atom.io/2016/11/14/removing-shadow-dom-boundary-from-text-editor-elements.html).  
This means the `:host` and `::shadow` pseudo-selectors should be completely removed and all syntax selectors should be prepended with `syntax--`.
To prevent breakage with existing style sheets, Atom will automatically upgrade selectors for versions less or equal to 1.12. (@arcticicestudio, #10 PR #11, 871948cd87)

# 2.0.0 (2016-11-10)
**The whole project has been cleaned up and rewritten to adapt the codebase of the [Nord Atom UI](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-atom-ui) project!**
*This closes the milestone [Version 2.0.0](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/northem-atom-ui/milestone/1) and the associated backlog ticket #2.*

## Features
Detailed information about new features can be found in the [README](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/northem-atom-ui/blob/develop/README.md#features) and the [Nord Atom UI](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-atom-ui#features) documentation!

### Color Palette
This major update has been migrated to the new Northem color palette version [`2.0.0`](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/northem/releases/tag/v2.0.0). (@arcticicestudio, #5, 8a51ee3f)

### Design
The old design was uncomfortable, inconsistent and has not been updated to the latest Atom version which resulted in unpredictable bugs and glitch due to changes of the Atom Core.
Northem Atom UI has adapted the Nord Atom UI design which provides a clean, elegant and up-to-date UI. (@arcticicestudio, #7, 2e38794e)  
(@arcticicestudio, #3, 6bb9ddf0)

All project documentations adapted the new project setup and styles and new branding assets have been added. (@arcticicestudio, #6, 24ce143d)
